    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2)

    // let name = 'Bre';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'Archie'
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];


    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'lux'; // changes the value for index 3 in both arrays

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // both arrays are updated to new value because team isn't its own array it is a reference to team


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() // if you pass slice nothing it takes a copy of the original array
    // now you can edit team2 or players without impacting the orginal array


    // one way ^

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'some other dude'

    const team5 = Array.from(players)// another way

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      dog: true,
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99; // nope, again this is a reference not a copy, what you do to one will affect the other 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Bre', age: 30 });
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = { ...person }
    cap3.hair = false;
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const bre = {
      name: 'bre',
      age: 30,
      social: {
        insta: 'breebot',
        facebook: 'bre thunholm'
      }

    }

    // const breBot = Object.assign({}, bre);
    const breBot = { ...bre };


    // you have to clone deep to get the deeper levels of the object
    //  a fix without cloning 
    const breBot2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(bre)); // makes a full copy .. poor mans deep clone
